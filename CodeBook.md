## The code book explains the variables in resultant data set
### The submitted result is called "HumanActivity.txt"
### It includes the subject, name of the activity and mean/std of the measurements
### Each of them has one column in the data set
* Activity - WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING
* Subject - 30 volunteers, each number represents one volunteer
* the remaining 66 columns represent mean and standard deviation of different activities along X, Y or Z direction
* tBodyAcc - time domain signals for the body linear acceleration
* tGravityAcc - time domain signals for the gravity acceleration
* tBodyGyro - time domain signals for the body angular velocit
* tBodyAccMag - time domain signals magnitude of the body acceleration
* tBodyAccJerkMag - time domain Jerk signals magnitude of the body acceleration
* f - if start with 'f', it indicates frequency domain signals
* mean()- if column names include mean(), it is the "Mean value" of the activity
* std()- if column names has std(), it is the  "Standard deviation" of the activity
