# Getting_Cleaning_Data
Course Project Submission
## This is a readme file to explain how the script works step by step
### There is only one script named "run_analysis.R" that performs all the steps described below
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Labels the data set with descriptive variable names for each column
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* add subject to the data set for each row
* get the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
* output the result as .txt file
